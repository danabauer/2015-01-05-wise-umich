<h2>Missing Data</h2>
<div class="objectives" markdown="1">
#### Objectives

*   Explain how databases represent missing information.
*   Explain the three-valued logic databases use when manipulating missing information.
*   Write queries that handle missing information correctly.
</div>

<p><strong>1 minute DISCUSS:Turn to another person near you (try to find someone new). Do you work with any data that has missing values? How do you enter it in your database? Do you use or ignore that data in your analysis? What are some potential problems when using data that has missing values? Ask 1-2 students to share</strong></p>
<p>Real-world data is never complete&mdash;there are always holes.
Databases represent these holes using special value called <code>null</code>.
<code>null</code> is not zero, <code>False</code>, or the empty string;
it is a one-of-a-kind value that means "nothing here".
Dealing with <code>null</code> requires a few special tricks
and some careful thinking.</p>
<p>To start,
let's have a look at the <code>Visited</code> table.
There are eight records,
but #752 doesn't have a date&mdash;or rather,
its date is null:</p>
<pre class="in"><code>select * from Visited;</code></pre>

<div class="out"><table>
<tr><td>619</td><td>DR-1</td><td>1927-02-08</td></tr>
<tr><td>622</td><td>DR-1</td><td>1927-02-10</td></tr>
<tr><td>734</td><td>DR-3</td><td>1939-01-07</td></tr>
<tr><td>735</td><td>DR-3</td><td>1930-01-12</td></tr>
<tr><td>751</td><td>DR-3</td><td>1930-02-26</td></tr>
<tr><td>752</td><td>DR-3</td><td>None</td></tr>
<tr><td>837</td><td>MSK-4</td><td>1932-01-14</td></tr>
<tr><td>844</td><td>DR-1</td><td>1932-03-22</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Null doesn't behave like other values.
If we select the records that come before 1930:</p>
<pre class="in"><code>select * from Visited where dated&lt;&#39;1930-00-00&#39;;</code></pre>

<div class="out"><table>
<tr><td>619</td><td>DR-1</td><td>1927-02-08</td></tr>
<tr><td>622</td><td>DR-1</td><td>1927-02-10</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>we get two results,
and if we select the ones that come during or after 1930:</p>
<pre class="in"><code>select * from Visited where dated&gt;=&#39;1930-00-00&#39;;</code></pre>

<div class="out"><table>
<tr><td>734</td><td>DR-3</td><td>1939-01-07</td></tr>
<tr><td>735</td><td>DR-3</td><td>1930-01-12</td></tr>
<tr><td>751</td><td>DR-3</td><td>1930-02-26</td></tr>
<tr><td>837</td><td>MSK-4</td><td>1932-01-14</td></tr>
<tr><td>844</td><td>DR-1</td><td>1932-03-22</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>we get five,
but record #752 isn't in either set of results.
The reason is that
<code>null&lt;'1930-00-00'</code>
is neither true nor false:
null means, "We don't know,"
and if we don't know the value on the left side of a comparison,
we don't know whether the comparison is true or false.
Since databases represent "don't know" as null,
the value of <code>null&lt;'1930-00-00'</code>
is actually <code>null</code>.
<code>null&gt;='1930-00-00'</code> is also null
because we can't answer to that question either.
And since the only records kept by a <code>where</code>
are those for which the test is true,
record #752 isn't included in either set of results.</p>
<p>Comparisons aren't the only operations that behave this way with nulls.
<code>1+null</code> is <code>null</code>,
<code>5*null</code> is <code>null</code>,
<code>log(null)</code> is <code>null</code>,
and so on.</p>
<p><strong>How do you think we could ask for null values? Do you think asking for where values=NULL or values!=NULL would work?</strong></p>
<p>In particular,
comparing things to null with = and != produces null:</p>
<pre class="in"><code>select * from Visited where dated=NULL;</code></pre>

<div class="out"><table>

</table></div>

<pre class="in"><code>select * from Visited where dated!=NULL;</code></pre>

<div class="out"><table>

</table></div>

<p><strong>How would we locate null values in another program, such as R (is.na)?</strong></p>
<p>To check whether a value is <code>null</code> or not,
we must use a special test <code>is null</code>:</p>
<pre class="in"><code>select * from Visited where dated is NULL;</code></pre>

<div class="out"><table>
<tr><td>752</td><td>DR-3</td><td>None</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>or its inverse <code>is not null</code>:</p>
<pre class="in"><code>select * from Visited where dated is not NULL;</code></pre>

<div class="out"><table>
<tr><td>619</td><td>DR-1</td><td>1927-02-08</td></tr>
<tr><td>622</td><td>DR-1</td><td>1927-02-10</td></tr>
<tr><td>734</td><td>DR-3</td><td>1939-01-07</td></tr>
<tr><td>735</td><td>DR-3</td><td>1930-01-12</td></tr>
<tr><td>751</td><td>DR-3</td><td>1930-02-26</td></tr>
<tr><td>837</td><td>MSK-4</td><td>1932-01-14</td></tr>
<tr><td>844</td><td>DR-1</td><td>1932-03-22</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Null values cause headaches wherever they appear.
For example,
suppose we want to find all the salinity measurements
that weren't taken by Lake.
It's natural to write the query like this:</p>
<pre class="in"><code>select * from Survey where quant=&#39;sal&#39; and person!=&#39;lake&#39;;</code></pre>

<div class="out"><table>
<tr><td>619</td><td>dyer</td><td>sal</td><td>0.13</td></tr>
<tr><td>622</td><td>dyer</td><td>sal</td><td>0.09</td></tr>
<tr><td>752</td><td>roe</td><td>sal</td><td>41.6</td></tr>
<tr><td>837</td><td>roe</td><td>sal</td><td>22.5</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>but this query filters omits the records
where we don't know who took the measurement.
Once again,
the reason is that when <code>person</code> is <code>null</code>,
the <code>!=</code> comparison produces <code>null</code>,
so the record isn't kept in our results.
If we want to keep these records
we need to add an explicit check:</p>
<p><strong>Ask for a student to suggest an answer for adding the check</strong></p>
<pre class="in"><code>select * from Survey where quant=&#39;sal&#39; and (person!=&#39;lake&#39; or person is null);</code></pre>

<div class="out"><table>
<tr><td>619</td><td>dyer</td><td>sal</td><td>0.13</td></tr>
<tr><td>622</td><td>dyer</td><td>sal</td><td>0.09</td></tr>
<tr><td>735</td><td>None</td><td>sal</td><td>0.06</td></tr>
<tr><td>752</td><td>roe</td><td>sal</td><td>41.6</td></tr>
<tr><td>837</td><td>roe</td><td>sal</td><td>22.5</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>We still have to decide whether this is the right thing to do or not.
If we want to be absolutely sure that
we aren't including any measurements by Lake in our results,
we need to exclude all the records for which we don't know who did the work.</p>
<h4>Challenges</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Write a query that sorts the records in <code>Visited</code> by date,
    omitting entries for which the date is not known
    (i.e., is null). <strong>You may need to google your options</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do you expect the query:</p>
<p>~~~
select * from Visited where dated in ('1927-02-08', null);
~~~</p>
<p>to produce?
What does it actually produce? Why?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>to think like a programmer, it can sometimes be helpful to simply read code. When I do a code review with collaborators or students, we will sometimes just look at the code, without running it, and read (in complete sentences, like we are reading a book) what we think the code is doing. This can help identify where we are wrong, what we misunderstand, and to discuss potential problems, or come up with solutions. Learning to program is like learning any other language. Practice allows you to get to the point (fluency) where you can comprehend new things using context clues and don't have to conciously interpret everything. Our goal today is to get you to novice-level practicitoners, but becoming fluent is something anyone can do with enough practice</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Some database designers prefer to use
    a <a href="../../gloss.html#sentinel-value">sentinel value</a>
    to mark missing data rather than <code>null</code>.
    For example,
    they will use the date "0000-00-00" to mark a missing date,
    or -1.0 to mark a missing salinity or radiation reading
    (since actual readings cannot be negative).
    What does this simplify?
    What burdens or risks does it introduce?</li>

<div class="keypoints" markdown="1">
#### Key Points
</div>

<ul>
<li>Databases use <code>null</code> to represent missing information.</li>
<li>Any arithmetic or Boolean operation involving <code>null</code> produces <code>null</code> as a result.</li>
<li>The only operators that can safely be used with <code>null</code> are <code>is null</code> and <code>is not null</code>.
</div></li>
